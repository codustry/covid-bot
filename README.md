## What is COVID Bot?

[COVID Bot](https://www.facebook.com/covid19bot/) is the **first** faceboot chatbot for assert the risk of SARS-COVID-2 powered by [chatfuel](https://chatfuel.com/) platform. This is a community collaboration. It has 2 languages, Thai and English. It is a fast reflex to soothe the COVID situation in early 2020, in Thailand just before the 1st wave community spread. It was so early that we got connect from agencies, it was pioneer for a few facebook bots that adopted our idea to their countries. These are the bot we knew so far.

## How it begins

On the evening of March 11, FREAK Lab reached out to us to help find a solution for Patient Under Investigation (PUI) in Thailand. During the outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), there was a surge in patients at the hospital. They predicted the hospital would not be able to handle the number of patients coming in for COVID-19 symptom diagnostic. In the meantime, Thai's citizen does not have any diagnostic tools that could help them self-diagnostic the symptom since COVID-19 can cause varieties of illness, which is why FREAK Lab and Codustry, including five doctors and two public relations, have teamed up to develop an application for Thailand.

The team has analyzed multiple options for Interface, Accessible, Platform & Tools, and Resources at that time that would be both for a rapid development and suitable for Thailand.

Due to the highly dynamic changes of situation as well as evaluating our workforce, we decided that the Chatbot - Button Based type is the most suitable way.
